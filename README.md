dev environment
- install .net 8
- install visual studio
- `dotnet workload install {platform}`
  - run this for each platform you want
  - `dotnet workload install maui` will simply install all platforms, but you probably want `maui-windows` `maui-android` and `maui-ios`
- open solution
- can try to run in windows natively if youre on pc
- otherwise, create an android emulator (not detailed here but you can do it completely within visual studio)
- run it
- file and issue if it doesnt work--pretty sure its self-contained for now
